**Abstract:** Automatic instance segmentation is a problem that occurs in many biomedical applications. State-of-the-art approaches either perform semantic segmentation or rene object bounding boxes obtained
from detection methods. Both suer from crowded objects to varying degrees, merging adjacent objects or suppressing a valid object. In this work, we assign an embedding vector to each pixel through a deep neural
network. The network is trained to output embedding vectors of similar directions for pixels from the same object, while adjacent objects are orthogonal in the embedding space, which eectively avoids the fusion of
objects in a crowd. Our method yields state-of-the-art results even with a light-weighted backbone network on a cell segmentation (BBBC006 + DSB2018) and a leaf segmentation data set (CVPPP2017).
